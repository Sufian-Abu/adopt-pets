# adopt-pets project
React learning with Hooks, Context, Portal, Parcel Js, Babel

# Run Project
  - npm run dev

# ReactJs: 
React JS is a JavaScript library used in web development to build interactive elements on websites.

# Hooks:
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are backwards-compatible.

# Context:
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

# Portal:
Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.

# Parcel Js:
Parcel is a web application bundler, differentiated by its developer experience. It offers blazing fast performance utilizing multicore processing, and requires zero configuration.
Th first problem that parcel-js solves is the dynamic lazy loading problem. In some application scenarios, like a webtop or a Single Page Interface application, you should not load all of the libraries and artifacts you application needs

# Babel:
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.
